# Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
'''for i in range(11):
    print(i)

count = 0
while count < 11:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
else:
    print("done")'''

#2. Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
'''for i in reversed(range(11)):
    print(i)

count = 10
while count >= 0:
    print(count)
    count = count -1'''

# 3. Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:
"""call = "#"
while len(call) < 8:
    print(call)
    x = "#"
    call = call + x"""




#. 4 Use nested loops to create the following:
'''num_rows = 8
num_cols = 8

for i in range(num_rows):
    for j in range(num_cols):
        print("#", end=" ")
    print()

#.5 
list2 = 11
for i in range(list2):
    product = i * i
    print(f"{i} x {i} = {product}")'''

#6. Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.
'''list = ['Python','Numpy','Pandas','Django','Flask']

for i in list:
    print(i)

#7. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers
for i in range(0,101,2):
    print(i)

#8. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers
for i in range(0,101):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)'''
